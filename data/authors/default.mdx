## My Education & Journey

Graduated with a degree in Agricultural Engineering from **Hue University of Agriculture and Forestry** in 2019, I initially ventured into the startup world by launching a little of startup — an **F&B small restaurant (2019–2020)** and a **flower & livestock farm (2020–2021)**.

After those ventures ended, I worked as a **food delivery rider for NOW (a food delivery app by Shopee)** before transitioning into the HR industry as a **Recruitment Specialist** in the second half of 2021.

From late 2021, I committed to **self-learning Information Technology**, and by June 2022, I landed my **first job in the tech industry** as a Full Stack Developer.

Since then, I’ve continued to learn and grow every day — expanding my skill set in web development, cloud computing, and blockchain. I’m passionate about continuous learning and adapting to new technologies.

In March 2023, I joined my **second tech company** as a **Full Stack Developer**, where I continue to learn and grow. With the **rapid advancement of technologies like AI**, I constantly update myself and integrate **AI tools** into my workflow to enhance productivity. At the same time, I focus on strengthening my **foundational knowledge** in technology, programming, and communication to effectively leverage these tools — ensuring that I can **stay aligned with AI** and not be replaced by it.

In May 2025, through **self-study**, I decided to test my **English skills** by registering for the **IELTS exam in Da Nang City**. With just **one month of preparation** — mainly focused on understanding the test format — and with a bit of luck, I achieved an **IELTS Band 5.0**. I’m now aiming for a **higher score of Band 7.0–8.0** within the next two years to support my **career development**.

### Objectives
