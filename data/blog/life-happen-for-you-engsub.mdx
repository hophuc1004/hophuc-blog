_A moment from Jim Carrey's speech that stopped me in my tracks._

## 🌱 The quote that made me pause

I stumbled upon this quote from a speech by Jim Carrey. Just a short sentence — but it made me stop. I went silent for a few seconds, then played it again. And again… several more times.

It echoed in my head as if I had discovered a secret. I immediately shared it with a friend and said, “I'm grateful I saw this video,” along with a screenshot from the speech.

## 🔍 What it means to me

- **"Life does not happen to you"** — Life isn’t something that _happens to you_, nor is it a string of events forcing you to suffer.
- **"Life happens for you"** — Life unfolds _for you_, for your growth, awareness, and transformation.

This quote doesn't deny the pain, struggles, or failures we go through. It simply invites us to _shift our perspective_:— from being a "victim," a "passive accepter," or someone who just "endures," to becoming a "learner," an "active participant," and a "changer."

Instead of asking:

> "Why is this happening to me?"  
> I’ve learned to ask:  
> "What is this trying to teach me?"

## 💡 How it inspired me

I’ve been through:

- A failed startup
- Delivering food in the blazing sun and pouring rain to make ends meet
- Learning to code during a quiet, lonely period of life
- Feeling completely lost and unsure of where I was going

But now, when I look back, I realize: **each of those experiences happened _for me_ — to help me grow, become more patient, and understand myself better.**

Without those tough days, there wouldn’t be the version of me who’s writing this today — with gratitude and the urge to share.

## 📣 Why I wrote this

I wrote this as a reminder to myself — and a message to you: if you’re going through a tough time, feeling lost, or life seems unfair…

> Maybe it’s happening _for you_, not _against you_.

You deserve hope, peace, and trust in yourself. And maybe, like me, all it takes is hearing the right words at the right moment.
