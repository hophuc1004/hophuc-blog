Hi there, I'm **Phuc** — once an Agricultural Engineer, then a startup founder, food delivery rider, recruiter, and now a Full Stack Developer. Since late 2021, I’ve been teaching myself how to code, and this blog is where I document my journey of growth — both professionally and personally.

## ✨ Why I started blogging

- **To document my journey**: As someone who transitioned into tech from a completely different background, I want to capture each step along the way.
- **To deepen my understanding**: Writing things down helps me reflect and remember better.
- **To share what I’ve learned**: Maybe something I’ve experienced can help someone who’s just getting started.
- **To improve my writing and English**: I’m preparing for the IELTS to boost my communication skills — and blogging helps me practice regularly.

## 📝 What I plan to write about

- My personal milestones
- Lessons I’ve learned
- My self-taught coding journey
- Learning English on my own
- Switching careers into tech
- Tools that boost productivity (AI, DevTools, etc.)
- Personal development and lifelong learning

## 🎯 My goals

- Publish at least one blog post every week
- Achieve IELTS Band 7.0+ within the next two years
- Become a consistent and thoughtful blogger
- Keep learning, keep sharing

I may not know who you are, but if you're also learning, switching paths, or simply trying to find a new direction — I hope this blog brings you some inspiration and connection.

Thanks for reading 🙌  
**— Phuc**
