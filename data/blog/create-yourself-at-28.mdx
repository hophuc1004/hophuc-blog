_Just landed â€” the first step into my new chapter._

Hello, my name is **Phuc**, and I'm 28 years old.

Today, I want to ask you a simple question:

> Have you ever done something **crazy** when you were young?

I'm not sure if I can still call myself "young" ^^.  
But I'm sure about one thing:

## ðŸ”„ I did something crazy â€” I recreated myself at 28

Yes, you heard that right. That's exactly what I mean.

I spent **months thinking about it** before I finally made the decision:  
I quit my job and moved to a completely new country, far away from my home in Vietnam.

## ðŸ’­ Why this decision?

Before this, I worked as a **Software Engineer**. It was stable, and knowledge was everywhere â€” in books, on YouTube, across the Internet. But I wanted more than just consuming knowledge. I wanted to **live it**, **experience it**, and **grow through it**.

And so, I **started over**.

## ðŸŒŸ What I want to share

In this space, besides learning and practicing English, I want to share with you:

- **The beautiful things I encounter**
- **The unique experiences I go through**
- **The lessons and realizations I'm gaining along the way**

I want to **experience first**, **reflect on it**, and then share it with you in the most genuine way I can.

## ðŸŽ¯ Being honest about my limitations

To be honest, my English is not great yet. My vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation still need a lot of work. Sometimes I'm afraid that when I share, it won't be "perfect." But I'll keep trying.

I know there will be many challenges ahead. But I'm ready to take them, **step by step**. And I hope you'll follow along with me on this new journey â€” one that, I believe, will be truly **meaningful and exciting**.
