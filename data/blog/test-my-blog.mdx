Today, I started writing about my daily life using **MarkText**, a clean and simple Markdown editor. It's lightweight, distraction-free, and perfect for journaling or blogging without all the noise of traditional word processors.

## ✍️ Why MarkText?

- **Live Preview**: I can see exactly how my blog post will look while I write.
- **Markdown Support**: Easy formatting for headers, lists, links, and even code blocks.
- **Offline Friendly**: No internet? No problem.
- **Distraction-Free**: No toolbars, popups, or menus getting in the way.

## ☀️ A Glimpse Into My Day

- Woke up early and made some green tea 🍵  
- Spent the morning learning about **Astro** and deploying to **Cloudflare Pages**  
- Installed **MarkText** using Homebrew  
- Started writing this post — right inside MarkText!

## 💡 Final Thoughts

It feels refreshing to have a simple tool that just works. No sign-in, no clutter, just writing. If you're looking for a way to start your writing habit, I highly recommend trying MarkText.

Thanks for reading! 🙌
